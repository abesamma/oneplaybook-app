# About Oneplaybook ðŸ“”

**Oneplaybook** is a web app that allows you to quickly get started building federated internal wiki systems with [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com), a popular open source non-linear note taking app, for personal use as well as for teams. You can think of it as your second brain service! Unlike most commercial wiki software services and other similar SaaS solutions, **Oneplaybook** offers you different ways to keep data on servers/cloud services you trust instead of forcing you into our own backend solution. In fact, we don't have any servers to begin with for you to worry about!

Instead, this web app acts as an offline-ready, intermediary app between you and your self hosted data, giving you a managed app service experience while keeping your data firmly in your hands. It also allows you to fork a copy of the software and modify/remix and release your own copy the app under MPL-2.0 licensing!

We at **Oneplaybook** are also constantly creating new ways to organize and collaborate on knowledge between individuals and teams. We welcome you to use our open source project and related tools for free, and we also welcome you to the wider TiddlyWiki community.

This webpage runs on Gatsby, Reactjs, TailwindCSS and Material-UI.
