            <span className="primary-text-bg font-bold">Oneplaybook</span> is a web app that allows
            you to quickly get started building collaborative wiki workspaces that allow you to more
            easily co-create and share useful knowledge and tools for thought built with TiddlyWiki,
            a popular open source non-linear note taking app that is used by many knowledge workers
            today. Unlike other, similar knowledge management software-as-a-service solutions,{' '}
            <span className="primary-text-bg font-bold">Oneplaybook</span> offers you ways to keep
            data on servers/cloud services you trust instead of forcing you into our own backend
            solution. In fact, we don&apos;t have any servers to begin with for you to worry about!
          </p>
          <p className="my-2">
            Instead, this web app acts as an offline-ready, intermediary app between you and your
            self hosted data, giving you a managed app service experience while keeping your data
            firmly in your hands. It also allows you to fork a copy of the software and modify/remix
            and release your own copy the app under MPL-2.0 licensing!

          <p className="my-2">
            We at <span className="primary-text-bg font-bold">Oneplaybook</span> are also constantly
            creating new ways to organize and collaborate on knowledge between individuals and
            teams. We welcome you to use our projects for free, and we also welcome you to the wider
            TiddlyWiki community.
